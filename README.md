# Spell-A-Mole
### This project was created by [@aj-bhatia](https://github.com/aj-bhatia), [@ItsDish](https://github.com/ItsDish), and [@amocz](https://github.com/amocz) during the 2021 The Odin Project Game Jam

#### Goals:
Our goal while creating the game was to create an easy and comfortable way for children to learn spelling and typing. Our game uses repitition of words in order to help children better familiarize themselves with words, and their spellings, while also throwing in some more challenging words for them to begin to learn! Additionally, they will be able to gain familiarity with keyboards and typing while playing the game, so they will become better typers in the future!

#### How Spell-A-Mole works:

The game has three different modes, easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty was created with the intention for different age ranges, so depending on the player's age, they will be able to see and type words that are appropriate for them, so that even older users will be able to learn as well! Additionally, the size and difficulty of words increase per difficulty, so this also is adjusted to how comfortable the user should be with a keyboard at this age range.

How we created this system allows for a fun and engaging way to learn spelling and typing, while also helping children become more comfortable around words they may have never seen before!
